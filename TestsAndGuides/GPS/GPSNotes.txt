GPS moudle notes

The PA1010D module is compataible with both Raspberry Pi and Arduino.
For saving power and keeping the interfaces clean, I have decided to use ardunio.
This means all sensors/controls (other than the simple pan/tilt hat for the camera) can be directed to one ic2 interface 
to the raspberry pi via the voltage leveler.
