Backing up and testing backup of rpi sd card.
Use windisk32Imager to make an img of the RPI sd card.
Note: you may need to run windisk32manager under compatability mode for windows 8 and as admin, make sure to unmount google drive or similiar services before hand.

Next, install osfMount (de-select readonliny option on boot) and boot and inspect all partitions as a testing

Burning the backup to an sd card requires either windisk32Imager again in write mode OR etcher

That's it!

Note: the Image in this repo is compressed to save on size

PW to unzip the RPIImage is 'Roboclub' this is the same password as used on the image
